### Assignment 3: Prototyping

#### Objectives 
This is an individual writing assignment that allows you to take one of the scenarios of use / design alternatives you created for the previous assignment and turn it into a full-fledged (albeit not necessarily functional) prototype of the product, system, or interface you are designing.

#### Tasks
Please note that this does NOT have to be a WORKING prototype; a non-working, prototype design is fine. You can create your prototype using any development tool at your disposal -- from sketching designs on paper to using online prototyping tools like Balsamiq or Mockingbird -- just be certain you have something visual to illustrate your ideas. If you want to include some interactive features, that's fine, but all you really need is a series of static pages or illustrations showing your prototype design.

#### General Requirements
* Write a paper covering the following points, in this order, using headings and subheadings to separate each point:
    - Briefly describe the product, system, or interface you are designing, and detail any changes in your thinking since the last individual assignment. This should be short!
    - Briefly describe the user of your product, system, or interface that you have in mind, and detail any changes in your thinking since the last individual assignment. This should be short!
    - Briefly describe the scenario of use you have selected to guide the design of your prototype product, system, or interface, and detail any changes in your thinking since the last individual assignment. This should be short!
    - Present your prototype product, system, or interface, and provide a detailed walkthrough that carefully explains HOW your prototype allows your user to complete your scenario of use. You are required to include sketches, screenshots, or some kind of visual media to accompany your written description of your prototype. N.B. This is HOW it works. This is important and should NOT be short!
    - Present a detailed design rationale explaining the choices you made when developing your prototype product, system, or interface. Be sure to explain WHY you believe the user described above will be able to use your prototype to complete your scenario of use. N.B. This is WHY (you believe) it works. This is even more important and should NOT be short!
    - Finally, briefly describe what you might do next (i.e., what changes would you make to your prototype design) if you were to continue to develop this prototype product, system, or interface in the future. What did you learn from making this prototype that would help you improve it in the future? This can be kinda medium length. :-)
* Submit your assignment to Canvas under the "Prototyping Design" assignment. Make sure your submission includes the name and number of the course, the instructor's name, YOUR NAME, the name of the assignment, and the date submitted. Length: minimum 1000 words.
