### Assignment 2: Designing Alternatives

#### Objectives 
This is an individual writing assignment that allows you to brainstorm three different design ideas for your proposed product, system, or interface. This is your chance to carefully consider your design alternatives, and not get locked into one way of thinking about your design too early.

#### Tasks
Spend some time thinking carefully about how your proposed product, system, or interface might support the types of users and scenarios of use you described in the previous assignment. What interface metaphors might you use? What types of interaction would be most useful?

#### General Requirements
* Write a paper covering the following points, in this order, using headings and subheadings to separate each point:
    - Briefly describe the product, system, or interface you are designing, and detail any changes in your thinking since the last individual assignment. This is essentially a recap of the last assignment, and should be short!
    - Select one of the three user types you detailed in your previous assignment, and briefly describe this type of user here, detailing any changes in your thinking since the last individual assignment. This is essentially a recap of the last assignment, and should also be short!
    - Identify THREE different scenarios of use that describe what your user might try to accomplish with your product, system, or interface -- it is fine if one of these turns out to be the same scenario of use you described in the previous assignment, but they should be three distinct / different scenarios from each other -- and complete the following for EACH scenario of use:
        + Provide a detailed description of this scenario of use that explains both a) what your user would be trying to accomplish with your product, system, or interface, AND b) why you believe this is a helpful scenario to consider when designing your proposed product, system, or interface.
        + Provide a detailed description of how your user could hypothetically use your proposed product, system, or interface to complete this scenario. Include a sketch (or some kind of visual example) along with your description, and be sure that each design alternative provided in this section differs substantially from the others (i.e., your goal here is to end up with three DIFFERENT ways of thinking through how you might design this product, system, or interface; NOT three different examples of the same design idea).
* Submit your assignment to Canvas under the "Designing Alternatives" assignment. Make sure your submission includes the name and number of the course, the instructor's name, YOUR NAME, the name of the assignment, and the date submitted. Length: minimum 1000 words.
