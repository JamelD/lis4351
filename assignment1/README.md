# LIS 4351 - User Experience Design

## Jamel Douglas

### Assignment 1: Establishing Requirements

#### Objectives 
This is an individual writing assignment that allows you to think about the user experience of a product, system, or interface that you would like to create. This can be something totally new you are just thinking about now, something you've been eager to develop for a while but not yet had the chance to design, or something you are already working on but not yet thought through in detail (just be sure your work for this class is original).

#### Tasks
Spend some time thinking carefully about your proposed product, system, or interface, including who its hypothetical users might be, and what they might use it to accomplish.

#### General Requirements
* Write a paper covering the following points, in this order, using headings and subheadings to separate each point:
    - Describe the product, system, or interface you would like to design and its intended purpose. If your idea is similar to an existing product, system, or interface, please explain briefly how your idea differs from or improves upon what has already been developed.
    - Describe in general the people who would use this product, system, or interface, and the sorts of things they would likely do with it.
    - Identify THREE types of users -- ideally, these would be users who have differing needs and expectations about your proposed product, system, or interface -- and complete the following for EACH user type:
        + Provide in detail either a) a user profile (e.g., Fortune 500 business executives who are frequent fliers and expect nothing but the best service while traveling, etc.) OR b) a user persona (e.g., "Steve" is a 52-year-old CEO from Chicago, IL, who regularly flies around the world (first class) with a cocker spaniel...); your goal here is to carefully consider the unique requirements of this user type with respect to your product, system, or interface.
        + Provide in detail a scenario of use that describes what a typical user of this type might be trying to accomplish with your product, system, or interface (e.g., a primary school teacher is planning to take their students to a museum on a field trip, and is visiting the museum's website to look for ways of integrating the museum visit into her classroom activities, etc.); your goal here is to carefully consider the unique actions, tasks, or goals of this user type.
* Submit your assignment to Canvas under the "Establishing Requirements" assignment. Make sure your submission includes the name and number of the course, the instructor's name, YOUR NAME, the name of the assignment, and the date submitted. Length: minimum 1000 words.
