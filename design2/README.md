# LIS 4351 - User Experience Design

## Jamel Douglas

### Design Sprint 2

#### Objectives 
You and your group will spend Tuesday (and whatever additional time you feel necessary between Tuesday and Thursday) preparing your design ideas, which you will then present to the instructor and the rest of the class on Thursday.

#### Tasks
Each group will be responsible for presenting their own design ideas, and answering questions about their design decisions from the instructor and the other students. Given time constraints, group presentations will be strictly limited to ten minutes each, plus three minutes for questions.

#### General Requirements
- Group presentations should be highly visual, engaging, and demonstrate the interactive components of your design in some way. Note that these presentations are in-class assignments only; you do not need to submit anything to Canvas.
- Also, while there will be one presentation per group, every group member should be involved with the presentation in some way. If you are going to miss either a Tuesday or a Thursday session during a week when we have a Group Activity scheduled, please let me know ASAP.
